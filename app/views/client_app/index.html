    <p>AirCasting is an open-source platform for collecting, displaying, and sharing health and environmental data. Our mission is to empower citizen scientists and communities by providing accessible tools to measure and understand their environment. The AirCasting platform consists of the AirBeam, a wearable air quality monitor, and our mobile and web applications.</p>
    <p>The AirBeam3 is a powerful, low-cost air quality monitor that measures particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10), temperature, and humidity. It connects seamlessly with the AirCasting app on your smartphone, allowing you to record, map, and graph your data in real-time. This data contributes to a global, crowdsourced dataset of hyperlocal air quality information, which is open and accessible to everyone.</p>
    <p>With the AirCasting app, you can monitor your personal exposure to air pollutants, participate in community mapping projects, and contribute to a greater understanding of air quality around the world. The data you collect helps power scientific research, inform public policy, and raise awareness about environmental issues.</p>
    <p>Our platform is used by individuals, educators, researchers, and community groups globally. Whether you are a concerned citizen wanting to know what you are breathing, a teacher looking for a hands-on science project, or a researcher studying environmental health, AirCasting provides the tools you need.</p>
